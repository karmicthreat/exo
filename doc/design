Objectives
----------
* Provide toolkit for declaring and generating messages
* Maintain and verify consistency within messaging protocols
* Split system up into modules for separation of concerns, that can be built separately or as a monolitic program
* Provide un-opinionated module to module communication.

Design
------
* Each module should name a set of message types that it can recieve
* Each module should name a set of message types that it can emit
* Module to module compatibility may be determined by the intersection of messages emitted by module1 with the messages received by module2
* Provide module boiler plate for config, update loop, fault recovery / handling
* Message version should be determined by a checksum on the struct
* Provide a few messaging implementations, stdout->stdin, pipes, shared address space, network, etc.
* Provide an interface for module configs on different platforms

	int32_t x, y, z;
